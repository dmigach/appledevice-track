# Draw GPS route on map

First run `cloud.py` and generate GPS coordinates log. 

While tracking (or after) run `map.py` to draw route on map.

It will require `Basemap` lib and `Maperative` utility aswell.

Currently `Maperitive` path is hardcoded in `map.py` at 95 line.

If you use `Linux/MacOS` you'll need `mono` aswell to run `Maperative`.
